* My Emacs Configuration

This is my emacs configuration repository.

** Dependences
   - libvterm
     It's used for the vterm.
     If you are an Arch user, you can install it by:
     #+begin_src shell
       sudo pacman -S libvterm
     #+end_src
   - The dependences in [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework][Emacs Application Framework]].(To use EAF)

** Installation
   To use my configuration, you should run ~make install~ to download the EAF.And then you can open emacs.

** Functions
   My package manager is ~package-require~ (A package manager written by me), and it's like ~use-package~.
   This is the usage for it:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
	;; This is a demo of eaf
	(package-require
	 'eaf
	 :outside
	 :before-load-eval '(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/third-party/emacs-application-framework")
	 :keymap '(("C-z C-w l" eaf-open-browser)
						 ("C-z C-w h" eaf-open-browser-with-history)
						 ("C-z C-m b" eaf-open-bookmark))
	 :delay-eval '(progn
									(eaf-setq eaf-browser-remember-history "true")
									(eaf-setq eaf-browser-default-zoom "1.0")
									(eaf-setq eaf-browser-dark-mode "true")))
#+end_src
   You can read its code in [[https://github.com/SpringHan/.emacs.d/blob/master/etc/init-require-package.el][init-require-package.el]].
