* My Emacs Configuration

This is my emacs configuration repository.

** Dependences
   - libvterm
     It's used for the vterm.
     If you are an Arch user, you can install it by:
     #+begin_src shell
       sudo pacman -S libvterm
     #+end_src
   - The dependences in [[https://github.com/manateelazycat/emacs-application-framework][Emacs Application Framework]].(To use EAF)

** Installation
   To use my configuration, you should run ~make install~ to download the EAF.And then you can open emacs.

** Functions
   My package manager is ~package-require~ (A package manager written by me), and it's like ~use-package~.
   This is the usage for it:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
     (package-require
      'package-name
      '(("key" function)
	("Other key" function) ; ...
	)
      '(hook function/hook)
      (progn
	(func1)
	(func2) ; ...
	)
      :hook '(other-hook other-function/hook))
   #+end_src
   You can read its code in [[https://github.com/SpringHan/.emacs.d/blob/master/etc/init-require-package.el][init-require-package.el]].

** Last
   I'm new in emasc, I'll continue to update my configuration everyday.
